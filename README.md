# cloudAssignment 2

Well this took alot of time for all of us so please be gentle with our baby xD

To start of this application is rather userfriendly and therefor we do have a html page
to display all the information for the user. I know, abit overkill! and not what the
assignment asked of us, but we did it regardless because it helped us alot with testing
and because we chill like that.

You can access this webpage at: "We'll put the link here once we have it xD"

However if you wanne deploy this service yourself we you will find the tutorial down 
here in this document!




## What is this application really?

Well this application is set up by your local FBI agent to spy on your internet activity!
Haha, just kidding! We wouldn't do such things.

Simply putting it, this is a country lookup application!

That means that you can type in a country, get that ID and look up the real time data for
that country you made, if one country isnt enough, make more! all the countries you make
are stored in a dedicated json file.

You can see the specific dashboard configurations too using the ID you got! forgot it?
Well no worries! with the view all dashboards feature you can just look up all and copy
the ID from there!

Dont wanne see a specific data like, temprature cause you know how hot it is outside
or perhaps the captial because you're a pro geo guesser? then you can edit what you wanne see
using the edit dashboard field! this allows you to checkbox what you dont wanne see for a
spesific country, hell! you can change the country! User friendlynes at its peak :)

Perhaps you made too many countries? or maybe you dont wanne have North korea stored on your pc?
well no worries! with the delete feature you can easily delete any country from your saved list.
all you need is the ID which is with most things.


Feeling like not visiting the site all the time, perhaps you just want a simply notification
every time someone changes or looks up your country? we got you covered! With our webhook
feature you add your own webhook to receive notifications whenever something happens!

and with all the features like view all webhooks. You can even see if your friends are spying 
on your country application. you can even look up specific ones. xP

Done receiving a million notifications because your friends edited North Korea a million times?
Just delete your webhook with our delete webhook feature! it doesnt get easier then this! x3

Lastly! What if you get no data at all? perhaps your application or even ours are down? well,
not to worry! we got a status check for all the api's used, there you can check if something
went wrong! 200 means they are up, 500 means they are down. 

Life doesnt get any easier with this application so feel free to credit us if you are kind. ^w^






## I wanne deploy the Service myself!

Alrighty! here is step by step guide on how to run this yourself on your own computer!

First step to be continued! xD

## Authors and acknowledgment

This project was made possible by 3 untalented individuals!

- Jørgen Andersen - Lead Procastinator!
- Ole Marcus H Markussen - Professional 0x Programmer!
- Izan Simon Rodriguez - The Database Problem!

Ole Marcus
- Made the front end! Html and javascript!
- Made webhooks possible!
- Structured every function and documents work in unison

Jørgen: 
- Made the backend Post, Get, Put possible
- Made the API end point paths work!
- Extensive testing of the front end and back end.
- Patching errors and task achiving to meet requirments for this task.

Izan
- Contructed and made the Firebase possibe!
- Made the program be able to run at all!
- Made the main!
- Made the docker file.

Team effort
- Most if not all the code was made as a team effort.
- Sitting long nights at uni and pushing out small and large amounts of code from ones computers.
- Tho it may seem as some pushed out large amoumts of code and some pushed out little, this is misleading.
    We all contributed our parts, orginized tasks and checked eachothers functions and code.
    The main takeaway is that when time is short and 3 dumb skulls get together, they can achive even the most
    biggest of tasks, atleast, thats what we hope xD
